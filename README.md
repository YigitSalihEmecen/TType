## üéØ Features

### üß† **Intelligent Word Selection**
- **Adaptive Algorithm**: Analyzes your 10 worst-performing letters and selects words containing them
- **Weighted Scoring**: Prioritizes words with your most problematic letters (worst letter = 10 points, 2nd worst = 9 points, etc.)
- **Normalized Selection**: Compares words fairly by dividing scores by word length to avoid bias toward longer words
- **Large Candidate Pool**: Selects optimal words from 50 random candidates for maximum effectiveness

### üìä **Real-Time Performance Tracking**
- **Rolling WPM**: Continuously calculated WPM based on your last 15 seconds of typing
- **Letter-Specific Accuracy**: Individual accuracy tracking for each letter A-Z
- **Rolling Accuracy**: Accuracy calculated from your last 500 characters, so improvement is immediately visible
- **QWERTY Layout**: Letter accuracy displayed in familiar keyboard layout for easy reference

### üé® **Beautiful Modern UI**
- **Glassmorphism Design**: Elegant frosted glass effects with backdrop blur
- **Cool Color Palette**: Professional grayscale-to-blue gradient theme
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - Letter circles blink when pressed
  - Color-coded accuracy (dark gray for poor ‚Üí blue-gray for excellent)
  - Smooth animations and transitions

### ‚ö° **Smart Text Display**
- **Fixed Cursor**: Horizontal line stays centered while text flows left
- **Infinite Scrolling**: Continuous word generation based on your weak points
- **Precise Alignment**: Accurate character-width calculations for perfect cursor positioning
- **Live Feedback**: Immediate color coding for correct/incorrect letters

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled
- Local web server (Python, Node.js, or any HTTP server)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YigitSalihEmecen/TType.git
   cd TType
   ```

2. **Start a local server**
   ```bash
   # Using Python 3
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Python 2
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server -p 8000
   
   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

### Why Local Server?
The app loads word lists from `words_common.txt` via fetch API. Modern browsers block local file access when opening HTML files directly (`file://` protocol) for security reasons.

## üìñ How It Works

### Adaptive Learning Algorithm

1. **Performance Analysis**: Tracks accuracy for each letter based on last 500 characters
2. **Weakness Identification**: Identifies your 10 least accurate letters
3. **Smart Word Selection**: 
   - Randomly samples 50 words from `words_common.txt`
   - Scores each word based on concentration of your weak letters
   - Applies weighted scoring (worst letter = 10x weight)
   - Normalizes by word length to ensure fair comparison
   - Selects the highest-scoring word

### Real-Time Metrics

- **WPM Calculation**: `(Correct Characters √∑ 5) √∑ (Time in Minutes)`
- **Rolling Window**: Always shows performance from last 15 seconds of active typing
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Individual letter performance from last 500 keystrokes
- **Visual Feedback**: Immediate color-coded response to every keystroke

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with Flexbox, CSS Grid, and custom animations
- **Fonts**: DM Mono (Google Fonts) for optimal code/typing aesthetics
- **Word Database**: 3000+ common English words (2-10 letters)
- **Architecture**: Single-page application with modular class-based JavaScript

## üéØ Key Components

### `TypingTrainer` Class
- **Word Management**: Loading, filtering, and intelligent selection
- **Performance Tracking**: WPM calculation and accuracy monitoring
- **UI Management**: Text rendering, cursor positioning, visual feedback
- **Event Handling**: Keyboard input processing and validation

### Smart Word Selection Algorithm
```javascript
// Simplified version of the core algorithm
selectOptimalWord() {
    const leastAccurateLetters = this.getLeastAccurateLetters(10);
    const candidates = this.getRandomWords(50);
    
    const scoredWords = candidates.map(word => ({
        word: word,
        score: this.calculateWeightedScore(word, leastAccurateLetters) / word.length
    }));
    
    return scoredWords.sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)[0].word;
}
```

## üé® Design Philosophy

- **Minimalist Interface**: Focus on typing without distractions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation across devices
- **Performance First**: Optimized for smooth 60fps animations
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios and keyboard-only navigation
- **Data-Driven**: Every design decision backed by typing improvement metrics

## üîß Customization

### Color Themes
Easily customize the color palette by modifying CSS variables in `styles.css`:
```css
:root {
    --primary-bg: linear-gradient(135deg, #2C2C2C 0%, #7BA3B0 100%);
    --accent-color: #7BA3B0;
    --text-color: #ffffff;
}
```

### Word Lists
Replace `words_common.txt` with your custom word list:
- One word per line
- Words are automatically filtered to 2-10 characters
- Supports any alphabetic characters

### Algorithm Parameters
Modify algorithm behavior in `script.js`:
- `getLeastAccurateLetters(10)` - Number of weak letters to target
- `getRandomWords(50)` - Candidate pool size
- Rolling accuracy window (currently 500 characters)
- WPM calculation window (currently 15 seconds)
